# Gesture Control System using OpenCV

This project is a gesture control system that uses OpenCV to recognize hand gestures and perform actions based on them. It allows users to control a computer or any other device using hand movements.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition: The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time.
- Gesture-based control: Users can perform various gestures to control different actions, such as moving the cursor, clicking, scrolling, etc.
- Customizable gestures: The system allows users to define their own gestures and associate them with specific actions.
- Real-time feedback: The system provides visual feedback to the user, showing the detected hand and recognized gestures in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/thatsabhishek/Gesture-Control-System.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Position your hand in front of the camera.
3. Perform the desired gesture to control the corresponding action.
4. Enjoy the gesture-based control of your device!
